<div class="description">
  <p>I have been blessed to live an interesting life filled with travel,<br>
     I have been to all areas of North America (and even got kicked out of <br>
    Europe)I have had jobs ranging from a tour bus driver in Alaska, a cruise<br>
     ship DJ in the Caribbean, to a casino pit boss in Washington. As an entrepreneur<br>
    I ran a successful party planning business, which led to becoming a politico working<br>
     on three campaigns (2 Senate, 1 Presidential). Eventually, I opened my own full scale <br>
     restaurant serving up delicious Mediterranean foods (Feta in Ocala, FL). Throughout all <br>
     these journeys I have always had a personal creative spark that I embellished with either<br>
    writing or performance. Having a syndicated humor column in the Spokesman-Review and<br>
     performing on stage in front of hundreds at notable venues like, Ocala Civic Theatre.<br>
    Last year my personal ambitions finally took me to New York City to pursue a career as an actor.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to acting, i'm also an avid gamer having created my own card game, "Regicide", you <br>
